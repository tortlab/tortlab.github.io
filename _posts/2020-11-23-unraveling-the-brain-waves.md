In a new [study](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000384){:target="_blank"} published in _PLOS Biology_, John Ioannidis and colleagues proposed a novel metric for scientific impact, in which professor Adriano Tort figured in the 100.000 top scientists based on his research contributions of 2019.

Professor Tort was accompanied by six other researchers in the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, a feat that rendered him a post on the university's website remembering his scientific trajectory and explaining his field of study.
